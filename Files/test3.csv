A description and explanation of how apples taste,"Most apples are a little sweet and a little tart, but neither characteristic overpowers the other. Some types of these apples will taste mild, while others will have stand-out flavor. As usual, that depends on the weather and harvest conditions.",1
a summary of different uses for apples,"Apples rank among the world's most popular fruits. Not only are they delicious eaten out of hand, but they're also a crisp addition to salads, a star in autumn pies, and a sweet complement to savory meat dishes.",2
explanation of why the sky is blue,"As white light passes through our atmosphere, tiny air molecules cause it to 'scatter'. The scattering caused by these tiny air molecules (known as Rayleigh scattering) increases as the wavelength of light decreases. Violet and blue light have the shortest wavelengths and red light has the longest.",3
a distinction between why the ocean is blue and why the sky is blue,"In other words, the color of the ocean and the color of the sky are related but occur independently of each other: in both cases, the preferential absorption of long-wavelength (reddish) light gives rise to the blue.",4
explanation of why the sun is yellow,"Color of Sunlight as seen on Earth's surface during day is yellow due to Rayleigh Scattering. Our Sun is actually white (mixture of all wavelengths of visible spectrum) if we see it from outer space or high-altitude airplanes. Our atmosphere scatters shorter to bigger wavelengths color from sunlight when the white light travels through it. During day, it scatters violet and blue colors leaving yellowish sunlight (the reason why sky is blue and sunlight is yellow). During morning and evening, the sun appears reddish because light rays needs to travel longer distance in atmosphere which causes scattering of yellow light too.",5
a definition of a biplane,A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other. ,6
the pros and cons of a biplane,"Biplanes offer several advantages over conventional cantilever monoplane designs: they permit lighter wing structures, low wing loading and smaller span for a given wing area. However, interference between the airflow over each wing increases drag substantially, and biplanes generally need extensive bracing, which causes additional drag.",7
an explanation of how a biplane flies,"In a biplane aircraft, two wings are placed one above the other. Each provides part of the lift, although they are not able to produce twice as much lift as a single wing of similar size and shape because the upper and the lower are working on nearly the same portion of the atmosphere and thus interfere with each other's behaviour. In a biplane configuration with no stagger from the upper wing to the lower wing, the lift coefficient is reduced by 10 to 15 percent compared to that of a monoplane using the same airfoil and aspect ratio",8
an explanation of why biplanes are obselete,"While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a monoplane wing. Improved structural techniques, better materials and higher speeds made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s.",9
the specifications of a biplane,"Technically this is the so-called 'stall speed', where air passes over the wings fast enough to sustain altitude, and for small planes this can be less than 50km/h (31mph).",10
process of refrigeration,"The refrigeration cycle starts and ends with the compressor. The refrigerant flows into the Compressor where it is compressed and pressurised.

categorization of pollination types,"There are two types of pollination: self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination is when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.",19

distinction of bread and pretzels,"Soft pretzels are just a yeast bread that is formed into a pretzel shape. The one big difference in pretzel making, as opposed to a regular bread, is that pretzels are boiled and then baked. It is the boiling that gives the outside of the pretzel its beautiful golden brown color and uniquely crisp and chewy texture.",26
a comparison of pretzels and popcorn,"Popcorn triumphed over pretzels for a number of reasons, as Joyce Hendley originally reported for EatingWell. Whole Grain: First, popcorn is 100-percent whole grain. Most Americans don't get enough whole grains, and they provide a healthy boost of vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants.",27

explanation of decomposition of animal carrion,"Decomposition of animal carrion is achieved primarily through the activities of invertebrates, such as flies and beetles, and large scavengers, generally other vertebrates such as opossums, raccoons, and vultures. Microbes, such as bacteria and fungi, are also important for carrion decomposition.",100
cause and effect of microbes on an ecosystem,"Microbes, such as bacteria and fungi, largely influence the flow of energy and matter throughout an ecosystem. Bacteria from the carcass and surrounding environment, such as soil bacteria, are essential for the decomposition of animal remains into organic matter and nutrients. It has been difficult to determine, however, what microbes are present, their overall contribution to the decomposition process, and how they influence invertebrate attraction to, and colonization of, a carcass. Bacteria are microscopic so they must be identified by phenotypic (microscopy and culturing), functional (biochemical) and genetic (sequencing) techniques. Using these techniques, we are now beginning to understand the diversity of microbial species present, and their interactions with other organisms, during carrion decomposition.",101

comparison of communism and socialism,"In both communism and socialism, the people own the factors of economic production. The main difference is that under communism, most property and economic resources are owned and controlled by the state (rather than individual citizens); under socialism, all citizens share equally in economic resources as allocated by a democratically-elected government. This difference and others are outlined in the table below. Another key difference in socialism versus communism is the means of achieving them. In communism, a violent revolution in which the workers rise up against the middle and upper classes is seen as an inevitable part of achieving a pure communist state. Socialism is a less rigid, more flexible ideology. ",116

comparison of AI and machine learning,"Concisely, AI can be described as the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. As such, AI is a general field that encompasses machine learning and deep learning, but that also includes many more approaches that may not involve any learning. Early chess programs, for instance, only involved hardcoded rules crafted by programmers, and didn¨ªt qualify as machine learning. In fact, for a fairly long time, most experts believed that human-level artificial intelligence could be achieved by having programmers  handcraft  a  sufficiently  large  set  of  explicit  rules  for  manipulating knowledge stored in explicit databases. It was the dominant paradigm in AI from the 1950s to the late 1980s, and it reached its peak popularity during the expert systems boom of the 1980s. Although  symbolic  AI  proved  suitable  to  solve  well-defined,  logical  problems, such as playing chess, it turned out to be intractable to figure out explicit rules for solving more complex, fuzzy problems, such as image classification, speech recognition, or natural language translation.
